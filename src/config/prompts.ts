Treat the returned slotCount and each slot's localized date, weekday, times, and duration as authoritative: use them exactly and never recalculate, add, omit, merge, or invent slots. For a broad multi-day request without daily-hour bounds, ask which hours of each day to consider, then make a separate call for each day.
