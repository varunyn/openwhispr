# keyboard-extension (Expo config plugin + iOS extension target)

A custom iOS keyboard extension that lets the user dictate from any text field system-wide. Tap the mic in the keyboard, the OpenWhispr app opens via the `keyboard-dictation` URL scheme, records, and the transcript is auto-pasted when the user returns to the host app.

| `withKeyboardExtension.js`            | Expo config plugin. Runs at `expo prebuild` time and adds the keyboard target to the generated Xcode project, links the entitlements, and configures the App Group capability. |
| `ios/KeyboardViewController.swift`    | The keyboard UI and lifecycle. Reads/writes shared state through the App Group `UserDefaults` suite (see [`modules/app-group-storage`](../../modules/app-group-storage/)).     |
| `ios/Info.plist`                      | Extension Info.plist (display name, RequestsOpenAccess, etc.)                                                                                                                  |
| `ios/OpenWhisprKeyboard.entitlements` | App Group capability entitlement                                                                                                                                               |

## How it works

1. User installs the keyboard from iOS Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New.
2. User opens any app, switches to the OpenWhispr keyboard, taps the mic.
3. Extension writes a flag to the App Group, then opens the configured app scheme at `/keyboard-dictation` (handled by [src/hooks/useKeyboardHandoff.ts](../../src/hooks/useKeyboardHandoff.ts)).
4. The main app starts a native recording, then sends the user back to the host app (`returnToHost` in [src/lib/handoffReturn.ts](../../src/lib/handoffReturn.ts)). iOS 26.4+ hides the host from the extension, so the containing app learns it from UIKit ([`HostAppObserver.swift`](../../modules/app-group-storage/ios/HostAppObserver.swift)). When no host is found, the app shows the "Swipe back to your app" screen instead.
5. Recording continues in the background. When stopped, the main app writes the transcript to `keyboard_pending_transcript` and the extension pastes it on next focus.

## Apple capabilities required

- **App Group** (`group.<ios bundle id>`) — must match between the main app, the extension, and the `app-group-storage` module.
- **Open Access** (`RequestsOpenAccess` in `Info.plist`) — required for the extension to read/write the shared suite.

## Environments

Runtime identifiers are resolved from `config/openwhispr-environments.js` and applied by `app.config.js` plus this plugin during prebuild.

- Production/TestFlight: `OPENWHISPR_APP_ENV=production`
- Development: `OPENWHISPR_APP_ENV=development`
- Local signing override: set `OPENWHISPR_IOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` and `OPENWHISPR_SCHEME` when needed. The App Group defaults to `group.<OPENWHISPR_IOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER>`.

Verify with:

```bash
OPENWHISPR_APP_ENV=development npx expo config --json
```

After changes, regenerate the native project:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
npm run ios
```

## Keyboard touch regression tests

On macOS with Xcode:

```bash
python3 openwhispr-mobile/plugins/keyboard-extension/tests/run-keyboard-touch-tests.py
```

Run it from the repository root after changing the keyboard layout, its padding or key targets; mobile CI runs it too. The runner compiles the production keyboard Swift source for Mac Catalyst, so it needs no simulator, signing credentials or Expo build. It tests UIKit hit routing across row gaps, overlapping key targets, unequal key widths, nested stacks, hidden layouts, disabled keys and keyboard boundaries, then lays out the real keyboard at several widths in letters and numbers mode, with and without the globe key, and checks that no tap below the dictation strip is dropped, the keyboard's padding included.

These touch tests do not measure typing latency. Before releasing,
check fast two-thumb typing and repeated letters on an iPhone, near-edge taps,
Shift, 123/ABC, space/return, held delete, keyboard switching, and dictation in
portrait and landscape in Notes and another host app.
